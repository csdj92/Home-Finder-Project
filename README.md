## Your Home

Your Home is a web application that allows users to sign up or log in with an enabled third party authentication system. Once you login you are able to view other listings, create listings, and create companies. I plan to add admin functions at a later time.

## Installation

You will need to install the necessary gems to run the application. Please clone this repository and run the following lines in your terminal:

$ bundle install $ rails db:migrate

For image uploading you will need to install ImageMagick on to your machine. Install instructions can be found here <http://www.imagemagick.org/script/download.php>

For general use of Shrine gem you can look here <https://shrinerb.com/>

## Usage

In order to start using the application, enter the following line in your terminal:

$ rails s

Next, open the server link in your browser (I recommend using Chrome) and enjoy using the application!
